<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

It's an expense tracker app where you enter your expenses data and track the latest expenses and do some other operations on it such as add, update and delete them.

### Built With

In this project I tented to used different libraries to implement my idea in a proper way, First off I used React Native as a framework to implement the SPA principles, I also used React Navigation and Expo-Cli and I tented to develop my skills and make it a responsive mobile app, I also used firebase as a backend to help me make dummy backend with the help of axios.


- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)
- [Expo Cli](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/expo-cli/)
- [Expo Linear grediant](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/linear-gradient/)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/)
- [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
